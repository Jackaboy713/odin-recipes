                    1 tbsp olive oil.</p></li>

                <li><p>Add 4 finely chopped bacon rashers and fry for 
                    10 mins until golden and crisp.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Reduce the heat and add the 2 onions, 2 carrots, 
                    2 celery sticks, 2 garlic cloves and the leaves from 
                    2-3 sprigs rosemary, all finely chopped, then fry for 10 mins. 
                    Stir the veg often until it softens.</p></li>

                <li><p>Increase the heat to medium-high, add 500g beef mince and cook 
                    stirring for 3-4 mins until the meat is browned all over.</p></li>

                <li><p>Add 2 tins plum tomatoes, the finely chopped leaves from 3/4 small pack 
                    basil, 1 tsp dried oregano, 2 bay leaves, 2 tbsp tomato puree, 1 beef 
                    stock cube, 1 deseeded and finely chopped red chilli (if using), 125ml

                <li><p>Bring to the boil, reduce to a gentle simmer and cover with a lid. Cook
