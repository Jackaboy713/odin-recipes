                <li>200g mozzarella from a block, cut into chunks</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
            <!-- forgot to use <p> to space the method out -->
            <!-- copy and pasted method but had to spent time 
            fitting it in to the format to make it neat. not 
            sure if it effects the outcome-->
            <ol>
                <li><p>First, make the dough. Tip the flour into a bowl and add 300ml tepid water.
                     Mix together and set aside at room temperature for 1 hr. Dissolve the yeast 
                     in 2 tbsp water and mix this and 15g of salt through the dough. Cover with
                     cling film and leave somewhere warm to double in size for a few hours. 
                     For a sourer flavour, leave in the fridge for atleast 8 hrs and up to 24 hrs.
                     (the longer you leave it the sourer it will be.)</p></li>

                <li><p>When the dough is ready, tip it onto a lightly floured surface and divide into four.
                    Roll into balls and leave to rest,covered with a tea towel or cling film for another hour.</p></li>

                <li><p>Now make the tomato sauce. Drain some of the juice from the can and tip the rest into a
                    bowl with the olive oil, oregano and a generous pinch of salt, then either scrunch 
                    everything together with your fingers for a chunky sauce or blitz with a stick blender 
                    if you want it smooth. Tie the basil stalks together, bruise with the back of a knife 
                    and place in the sauce. Leave the sauce at room temperature until needed.</p></li>

                <li><p>To make the pizza, heat a grill to its highest setting and get a heavy frying pan. 
                    On a floured surface push and stretch one of the balls of dough out into a circle 
                    roughly the same size as the frying pan. Slip the round onto a floured baking  sheet and 
                    top with a quarter of the sauce, a scattering of cheese, a few basil leaves and a quarter of the 
                    mozzarella.</p></li>

                <li><p>Get the pan very hot and carefully slide the pizza onto it. Cook for 2 mins, then put the pan 
                    under the grill for another 2 mins until the sides are puffed up and the cheese has melted. 
                    Lift onto a board, drizzle with a little olive oil if you like, then cut into wedges and 
                    serve while you make the next one.</p></li>
             </ol>
